Hello! My name is Pedro Henrique and I am an undergraduate student in Computer Engineering at the Fluminense Federal Institute, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. I have been working with astronomy since 2022 and am currently involved in my third research project, focusing on stars and the structure of our Galaxy. I am passionate about open-source initiatives and scientific communication, and I seek to combine computational methods with astrophysical problems to help make science more accessible and collaborative.

# What you can find out here

Here on this page you will find out some links and contents that i had produced. On the left side of your screen, there is some links such as my socials, and academic things. On the right side of each page, you can see the contents listed so you can easily go where you want. For the pages, each of them were built carefully to represent myself in the page. In Research you can find everywork explained (short version) that i have worked on. In Resources you can find classes materials, LaTeX layouts, some systems open source, and things that i recommend at all, I like to call it my own public archive of mind, or more easyly PAM. For the media page, there is a carrousel for each event i went to since i'm on high school or college. You can see conferences, talks, academic weeks or science fairs. In the Blog section, you may find some (random) posts. I can post good things, or bad things (not bad at all). In the end, the Publications brings a short way to see all the papers, proceedings et al I produced, organized by year. Also, there is a link to a public library at NASA ADS that has the same content.
