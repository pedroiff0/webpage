Hello! My name is Pedro Henrique and I am an undergraduate student in Computer Engineering at the Fluminense Federal Institute, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. I have been working with astronomy since 2022 and am currently involved in my third research project, focusing on stars and the structure of our Galaxy. I am passionate about open-source initiatives and scientific communication, and I seek to combine computational methods with astrophysical problems to help make science more accessible and collaborative.

## Research & Interests

- Reproducible computational workflows and tooling
- Empirical software engineering
- Data-driven experiments and visualization
